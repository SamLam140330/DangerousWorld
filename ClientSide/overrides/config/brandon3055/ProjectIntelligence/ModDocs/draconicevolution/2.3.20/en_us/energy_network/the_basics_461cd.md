The Draconic Evolution energy network is unlike any other. Both visually and functionally it is unique.

Before you get started messing with this system you will need a Crystal Binder.

The DE energy network is comprised of "Energy Crystals." Each energy crystal has an internal energy buffer and crystals can be linked to one another using a Crystal Binder. When 2 or more crystals are linked, they will attempt to balance their stored energy so they are both at the same charge level. Each crystal can only support a certain number of connections to other crystals. The exact number of connections is determined by the type and tier of the crystal.

######§nLinking
In order to link a crystal to another crystal or some other valid device simply shift-right-click on one of the crystals with a binder, which will save that crystal to the binder. Then simply right-click the target block to create a link. The binder will remember the block it is bound to until you bind it to another block or shift-right-click the air.

######§nGUI
When you look at a crystal the DE HUD will give you information about its links and energy flow. Right clicking on a crystal will display its GUI, in which you will see a list of all linked devices as well as the energy flow to each one. Clicking on an item in the list will give you the option to identify a link using a red beam between the crystal and the target device, as well as an option to break the link. There is also a button at the top of the list that allows you to clear all links.

######§nCrystal Types
There are 3 types of crystals. Energy I/O, Energy Relay and Wireless Energy.

§6Energy I/O:§r
This is the crystal you will use to insert and extract energy from your crystal network. To use this crystal, simply place it on the side of your energy source/consumer and connect it to your crystal network. This crystal has 3 I/O modes which you can cycle between by shift right clicking with an empty hand. Input, Output, and Balance. Input will make the crystal accept energy from the block it is attached to and output will attempt to send energy to the attached block. Balance mode is not yet fully implemented but is meant for use with energy conduits from other mods. This functionality needs to also be supported by the other mod and thus may not work with all conduits. This crystal type only supports a very limited number of connections to other crystals.

§6Energy Relay§r
This crystal is meant to act as a hub to which you can connect other crystals. Therefore it supports a lot more connections than the I/O crystal. This crystal can only link to other crystals and cannot be connected to other blocks.

§6Wireless Energy§r
This crystal is similar to the energy relay except that it supports fewer crystal links, but can wirelessly connect to a number energy receivers. This connection can supply or receive power from devices depending on the crystals i/o mode. The max energy flow is lower than that of the I/O Crystal. The advantage of this crystal is that it supports a large number of connections, meaning you could place one in the middle of your workshop and have it power most, if not all, of your machines. Or place it in the middle of your power pland and have it pull power from all of your generators.

Note: See the page for each crystal type for a full list of stats. 

§6Energy Visualization§r
When energy is flowing between two crystals it can be visualized by a beam of energy the intensity of which roughly indicates the rate at which energy is flowing. When energy is flowing from a wireless energy crystal to a block, the energy flow is indicated by a stream of particles the density and speed of which roughly indicates the rate at which energy is flowing.
