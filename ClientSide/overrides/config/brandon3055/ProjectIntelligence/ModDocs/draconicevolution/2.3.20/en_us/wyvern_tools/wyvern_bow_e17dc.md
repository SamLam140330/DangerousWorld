§6Arrow damage: base 2, Upgradable to 6

§6Arrow Velocity: base +100%, Upgradable to +300%

§6Auto Fire Mode
Will automatically fire when the bow is fully charged.

§6Explosion Power
Allows you to make your arrow explosive.
Max power is equivalent to TNT

§6Magnification
Allows you to zoom in on the target to increase your accuracy

§aInfo
Damage is calculated by multiplying arrow velocity with arrow damage with some randomness involved.

The energy required per shot is calculated by multiplying damage, velocity, and explosion power.
This means that just setting all 3 to maximum will require an enormous amount of power per shot.
