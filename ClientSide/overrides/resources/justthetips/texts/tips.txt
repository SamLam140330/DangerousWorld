Auto-craft is your best friend
Don't forget you have Seared Heater and Melter in Tinkers' Complement
There will have a blood moon every 30 days and a 5% chance each day
Use F7 to see the light levels on the ground
Use F9 to see the chunk borders
Grue will spawn when the light levels are lower than 5
Get cobblestone as fast as possible on the first day
Mekanism cables tend to cause lag, be careful not to overuse them
The sound is much more realistic in this Modpack
Always bring some light source like torch when you go to the adventure
