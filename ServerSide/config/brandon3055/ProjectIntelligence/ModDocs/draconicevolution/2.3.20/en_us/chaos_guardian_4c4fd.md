Looking for a challenge? The fight of your life! The Ender Dragon wasn't hard enough? Maby try 100 ender dragons all at once plus maby a few dosen withers. And if thats still not hard enough then maby this is for you! If you travel to any multiple of 10,000 in The End (e.g. {x=0, z=10000}, {x=0, z=20000}, {x=10000, z=0} etc.) you will find a Chaos Island.

A Chaos island is a formation of end stone and obsidian formed over billions of years by dark energy. At its heart in an obsidian chamber is a crystal made from pure dark energy known as a Chaos Crystal.

Chaos islands are protected by one of the most powerful mobs in existence. The Chaos Guardian. These guardians were once regular enderdragons but exposure to the dark energy of the chaos islands has mutated them into some of the deadliest killing machines of all time.

The various attacks of the Chaos Guardian will cut through almost any armor with one exception being draconic armor with its ability to block piercing damage. However it has the ability to rabidly drain any RF powered armor of its charge so it will quickly render your armor useless if you don't keep it charged.

Like the ender dragon the guardian has several healing crystals spread around the island. But unlike regular ender crystals these crystals are not so easy to destroy. They each have 50 hit points and when damaged will protect themselves with a shield for several seconds. You must disable all of the crystals before the guardian can be damaged.

Be aware that when low on health the guardian will occasionally try to re ignite some of the disabled crystals.

Once the guardian is defeated you can claim your reward. At the centre of the island several blocks below the surface you will find a chaos chamber containing a chaos crystal. When broken the chaos crystal will drop 5 chaos shards.

§4Be Warned!§r When you destroy the crystal the energy field it was generating will collapse. This will result in the total animation of the island within a matter of seconds. Unless you are wearing full draconic armor you will only have a few seconds to collect the shards and escape the island before you are obliterated along with the island.
