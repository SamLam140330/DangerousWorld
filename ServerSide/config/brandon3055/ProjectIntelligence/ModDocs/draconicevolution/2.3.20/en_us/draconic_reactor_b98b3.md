So you want power? An insane amount of power? Well you have come to the rite place! The draconic reactor is one of the most powerful and efficient generators in existance! But with great power comes great destrictive potential! So make sure you read the instructions before you get started!

To get started you will need the reactor core itself, 4 reactor stabilizers and a reactor energy injector. You will also need atleast 2 §link[draconicevolution:flow_gates]{alt_text:"Flux Gates"} to regulate the reactor.

The reactor layout is fairly simple. The reactor core goes in the center with the 4 stabilizers placed in a ring around it. The stabilizers can ba placed in a horizontal ring around the reactor as shown in the picture above or they can ve in a vertical ring with stabilizers above and bellow the reactor (similar to the stabilizer placement for the energy core)

Next place the energy injector on one of the remaining 2 sides facing the core. For a max size reactor the stabilizers and injectors should be atleast 4 blocks away from the reactor. As the reactor heats up it will expand and if it colides with the injector or stabilizers they will be destroyed resulting in a catastrophic falure.

To run the reactor safely you will need a large energy buffer such as a §link[draconicevolution:energy_storage_core]{alt_text:"Draconic Energy Core"}. You will also need a substantial amount of energy to kick start the reactor.

The final step is to setup the Flux Gates. Use one to regulate power flowing from your energy storage to the energy injector. Use the other to regulate the energy flow from the back of one of the reactor stabilizers to your energy storage. 

Note for a max size reactor the energy transfer system you use should be able to handle several hundred thousand RF per tick. I recommend atleast wyvern tier energy crystals (do not use wireless) or cryo-stabilized fluxducts.

And with that you have a minimal reactor setup capable of generating power!

##### §4§nWarning!
If you try to run the reactor at this point without first understanding how it works i can almost guarantee you will end up with a giant smoking crator where your base used to be!

If you dont already know how the reactor works i recommend atleast reading the page that explains the §link[draconicevolution:draconic_reactor/basic_operation]{alt_text:"Basic Operating Principle"} before you continue. Also keep in mind the reactor you have built at this point has no §link[draconicevolution:draconic_reactor/regulation_and_safety]{alt_text:"Regulation or Safety Systems"} to shut it down if somethign goes wrong.

And lastly i would just like to say this reactor is definitely not for everyone. If you want you can probably find a step by step tutorial to get a working reactor but if you dont actually understand what the reactor is doing your just asking for trouble. If your a very technical minded individual like myself then by all means dive in and have fun! But if you are unable to grasp the complexities of this reactor i recommend you steer clear and find a safer power gen alternative.
