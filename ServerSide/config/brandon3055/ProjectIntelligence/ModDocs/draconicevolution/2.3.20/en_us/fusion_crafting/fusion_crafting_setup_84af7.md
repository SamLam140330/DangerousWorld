##### §nGetting started with fusion crafting

The setup process is actually fairly simple.
Just place a fusion crafting core. Then place fusion crafting injectors anywhere you like to the north, south, east, west, above or below the core.
All injectors need to be at least 1 block away from the core and can be offset in any direction on their axis by 1 block.

That may sound a little confusing so take a look at the image below.
Each glass block represents a valid location for an injector.

So as you can see from that injectors can be placed up to 16 blocks away and as long as they are within the area shown and pointing at the core with no obstructions they will work.

Something to note about fusion crafting is that it does not matter how many injectors you have as long as you have enough for your recipe.
You can also mix and match injector tiers. Meaning if you have a mix of Basic and Wyvern injectors you can still do Wyvern crafting as long as you only use the Wyvern injectors for those recipes.

The last thing you will need to do is supply power to the crafting injectors.
The amount of power required will depend on the current recipe but all Injectors used by a recipe require power.
